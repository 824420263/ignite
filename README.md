# Ignite CLI

<p align="center">
  :fire: The hottest CLI for React Native boilerplates. :fire:
  <br/>
</p>

**NOTE: Ignite CLI is currently being rewritten to be faster, slimmer, and better!**

### Why Ignite CLI?

- **Easily spin up a new React Native app** with best practices built-in
- **No runtime!** This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on and figure out how to upgrade
- **An ever-expanding list** of React Native and Expo [boilerplates](#boilerplates) to jump-start your app
- **An amazing [community](http://community.infinite.red)** of other Ignite / React Native developers when you need help
- **Battle tested** and used every day by the developers at Infinite Red and thousands of developers around the world
- **Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux** because not all React Native developers are on one platform
- **Saves an average of two weeks** on your React Native development

And you also get (by default) all of the sweet, sweet goodness of [our default boilerplate, Bowser](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser), or choose [one of many others](./BOILERPLATES.md).

## Install

First, make sure you're set up for [React Native](https://academy.infinite.red/p/installing-react-native-tutorial-on-macos)

then...

```sh
$ npx ignite-cli new MyNewAppName
```

## Quick Example

Infinite Red provides two primary boilerplates; they are:

- **Bowser** - the latest and greatest Infinite Red boilerplate (React Navigation, MobX State Tree, & TypeScript). [Why MST over redux?](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser#why-this-stack)
- **Andross** - the legacy Infinite Red boilerplate (React Navigation, Redux, & Redux Saga)

### Use Ignite Bowser: [Infinite Red Bowser boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser)

Watch Jamon Holmgren's talk at React Live Amsterdam where he uses Ignite Bowser to build an app in less than 30 minutes:

```

### Use Ignite Andross [Infinite Red Andross boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-andross)

```sh
$ npx ignite-cli new PizzaApp
  ( Choose Andross when prompted )
```
